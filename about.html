            <p>My music library has grown to be a mess over the years as I have discovered more and more music. I will find music in my library that I'm not sure I ever actually listened to. With SoundScope, users can rate albums they have listened to, so down the road they can look back and see what music they have enjoyed, as well as see what others are enjoying.</p>
