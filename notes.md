## AWS Notes

I think it is super useful that you can enter * as the record name when creating a record so any subdomain will route to where you want it to. 

AWS -- IP Address  

Route 53 -- Through AWS, but where you lease a domain name.  

To enable HTTPS and allow a secure a connection, use Caddy to :80 and yourdomainname to your domain name

Use commands:
-shells into production environment server  
`ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[domainname]`  
-Edit Caddy's configuration  
`cd ~`,
`vi Caddyfile`
