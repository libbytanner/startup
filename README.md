### Elevator pitch

My music library has grown to be a mess over the years as I have discovered more and more music. I will find music in my library that I'm not sure I ever actually listened to. With SoundScope, users can rate and review albums they have listened to, as well as see what others are enjoying.

- **React** - Used for buttons, adding functionality
